# LinearLassoRidgeRegression
This project was for Farm Credit Canada (FCC). It has Linear, Lasso and Ridge Regression Models with 89.5% accuracy for predicting the losses on a lending
Financial Institutions are expected to hold capital reserves sufficient to withstand unlikely but
potentially catastrophic loss events. The reserve for a risky loan is higher than the reserve for a safer
loan, and this difference should be reflected in the interest rate offered by the lender. However, the loss
calculations are too cumbersome to be performed every time someone seeks a loan. The goal of this
project is to approximate those loss calculations, with an alternative model that could be fast enough to
use during lending, but sufficiently accurate to avoid under- or over- pricing loans
Expected outcome
The expected outcome would be a Python function or method that predicts the outcome of the “true”
loss calculation process for an arbitrary loan. This function or method will be applied to a TEST dataset
whose “true” loss reserve amounts have been withheld, and its performance will be assessed against
those “true” amounts
